# "Create a custom hook that allows saving items to the local storage" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Third day of the calendar, this time doing a custom hook that saves data to local storage
- Not as simple as I thought! Took my time to think the solution and read a lot of doc in order to fully grasp it
- Again, just a main branch as this is a little project
- Copied the main branch of the repo provided by the challenge, because the original had a solution in another branch and I didn't want to get tempted into looking into it!

**NOTE:** not much to say about this, but it was nice to have an challenge that had more to do with logic and hooks than to rendering components!
