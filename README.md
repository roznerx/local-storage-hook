# Create a custom hook that allows saving items to the local storage

You will start from an existing Todo List app built with React. It works great - users can add / remove items - but there is only one problem - every time the page is refreshed, all the items are lost.

Your task will be to implement persistence - the list of tasks should be saved to local storage, so that the user can continue where they left off after closing and reopening the browser window.

Implementation notes:

- Use a custom hook to encapsulate the saving to local storage logic

## Getting started with this repo

- Run `npm install` before you get started.
- Add your code to the `src/use-local-storage.js` file.
- Run the app with `npm start`
